		<li>I selected the Calendarific API, which allows me to get a bunch of interesting information
			about holidays in the US and beyond.</li>
		<li>I found it in the description of this github repository - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis, and used it because it had
			CORS on! </li>
		<li>I used several options to filter this data. I only got information about US holidays, and made the search
			specific to November 2020 as well, as you can see in the request URL.
			</li>
		<li> I think that this API could be useful in some kind of smart planner which will schedule meetings or appointments - with this info it could avoid scheduling
			on holidays that might be important to you. I think it would also be useful for some kind of general purpose calendar application - integrating these holdifays
			with your actual events like google calendar does.</li>
